		Uploads are not visible from the sidebar navigator and are only accessible from the link generated from parsing here (so remember the link).
		Uploaded matches are not included in *records* stats.
		Uploaded matches and their links may be deleted or overwritten at some point. 
		Matches uploaded will typically be added to the main database at a later date.

		All uploads from the same date are shared within the same series.
		The program will attempt to check for duplicate files, otherwise and reuploads of matches will not overwrite the old match.
		Demos of the same match from multiple pov's will not be flagged as duplicate files.	
		File names are not preserved when uploading. 

		There is a daily limit to number of uploads to manage storage space, so don't mass-upload demos.
		Contact xhiggy if you'd like to add a large amount of demos to the site.
		Invalid demos will likely result in an error or incorrect parsed data (team sizes too small, more than 2 teams, etc.).
		Demo parsing may temporarily disable match viewing while demo is parsing (~10 seconds).
